# Deployment Guide: Social Media Empire Platform to Vercel

## Prerequisites

1. A Vercel account (free at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
2. A GitHub account (where your repository is already pushed)
3. This repository: https://github.com/cornmankl/sosial-media-empire-platform

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Vercel Account

1. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in or create a new account
2. If creating a new account, verify your email address

### Step 2: Import Your GitHub Repository

1. On the Vercel dashboard, click "New Project"
2. Click "Continue with GitHub" and authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account
3. In the "Import Git Repository" section, search for "sosial-media-empire-platform"
4. Click "Import" on your repository

### Step 3: Configure Project Settings

During the import process, Vercel will automatically detect this is a Next.js project. You'll need to configure a few settings:

1. **Project Name**: You can keep the default or change it to something like "social-media-empire"
2. **Framework Preset**: Should be automatically detected as "Next.js"
3. **Root Directory**: Leave as default (root directory)
4. **Build and Output Settings**: Leave as default

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

In the "Environment Variables" section, add the following:

```
DATABASE_URL=file:./db/custom.db
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 5: Deploy

1. Click "Deploy"
2. Vercel will now:
   - Clone your repository
   - Install dependencies
   - Build your Next.js application
   - Deploy to a preview URL

### Step 6: Monitor Deployment

1. You'll see build logs in real-time
2. The process typically takes 3-5 minutes
3. Once complete, you'll receive a preview URL

### Step 7: Production Deployment

1. After reviewing the preview, you can promote it to production
2. Or make changes to your code and push to GitHub for automatic deployments

## Important Considerations

### Database Limitations

This project uses SQLite, which:
- Works on Vercel for basic operations
- Has limitations in serverless environments
- May not persist data between deployments
- For production use, consider migrating to PostgreSQL or MySQL

### Real-time Features

The Socket.IO implementation:
- Has been configured for Vercel compatibility
- May have limitations in serverless environments
- Works best with consistent server instances

### Custom Server

The project uses a custom server (server.ts) which:
- Has been updated for Vercel compatibility
- May require additional configuration for full functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

If you encounter build issues:
1. Check the build logs for specific error messages
2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed in package.json
3. Verify the build script in package.json is correct

### Runtime Issues

If the deployed application doesn't work correctly:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check the Vercel function logs
3. Verify environment variables are correctly set

### Database Issues

If there are database connection issues:
1. Ensure DATABASE_URL is correctly set
2. For persistent data, consider using a cloud database service

## Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Test All Features**:
   - Verify the dashboard loads correctly
   - Test API endpoints
   - Check real-time features
   - Verify database operations

2. **Configure Custom Domain** (Optional):
   - In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings"
   - Click "Domains"
   - Add your custom domain
   - Follow DNS configuration instructions

3. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   - Enable Vercel Analytics
   - Set up error tracking
   - Configure performance monitoring

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Vercel documentation
2. Review the project README.md
3. Examine the build and function logs
4. Reach out to Vercel support if needed

## Future Enhancements

For a production environment, consider:
1. Migrating to a cloud database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
2. Implementing proper user authentication
3. Adding data backup and recovery
4. Setting up CI/CD pipelines
5. Implementing caching strategies
6. Adding security headers and HTTPS enforcement
